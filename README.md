# 🌟 Anemia Prediction by Classification 🌟

This project is an innovative machine learning application designed to predict anemia risk by taking inputs like red pixel, green pixel, blue pixel intensities, and hemoglobin levels. Using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm, the app processes patient data to deliver accurate anemia predictions. Developed with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, the app ensures a user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **User Input**: Inputs for red, green, blue pixel intensities, and hemoglobin levels.
- **Prediction**: Outputs a prediction indicating whether there is a high risk of anemia.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

    ```
2. **Enter the patient data:**
    - Select the sex.
    - Input the red, green, blue pixel values.
    - Input the hemoglobin level.
3. **Get the prediction:**
    - Click the "Predict" button to see if there is a high risk of anemia.

## Model

We use the Naive Bayes classification algorithm for anemia prediction. We found Naive Bayes suitable due to its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in handling the features used in this project. Naive Bayes works well with the input features such as pixel intensity values and hemoglobin levels, providing reliable predictions.
